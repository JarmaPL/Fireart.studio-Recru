## Development Problem

- `Redux: When it comes to redux with typescript I could have used mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps and then connect with the component but as the 'react-redux' documentation hints at using '@reduxjs/toolkit' so I used that solution.`
- `Persist store: My idea was based on using data from other views. here was the problem I had to solve using 'redux-persist'. `
- `The only problem I struggled with for about an hour was formatting text in input as numbers with spaces.`
